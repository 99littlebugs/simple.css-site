# ✉️ Contact Me

So you want to get in touch with little old me? I’m honoured, thank you! There are a number of ways for you to send me a love letter 💌 on this page. Feel free to use any of them, but email will likely get you the quickest response 📨.

Before you contact me, there are a couple of things that I would like you to be aware of / consider:

* I don’t accept guest posts. Sorry, this is a personal blog.
* Before asking for help, please do your own research first. I’m willing to help where I can, but I’m a busy guy. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a great place to start.
* Please be polite; I’ll always be polite to you. 🥰

## 📨 Email: [kev@craves.coffee](mailto:kev@craves.coffee)

Email is the easiest way to get in touch with me. I’ll usually respond fairly quickly, often within 24 hours 🕒.

If you want to send me an encrypted email 🔒 ✉️, you can use [my public key](/public-key) 🔑.

## 🗝️ Keybase: [@kevq](https://keybase.io/kevq)

Keybase is a great way to get in touch with me securely 🔒 and privately 🕵️ . You can also use my Keybase profile as proof of my other identities online.

## 🐘 Mastodon: [@kev](https://fosstodon.org/@kev)

I am one of the admins on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/), which is a Mastodon instance. If you want to follow me on Mastodon, search for **@kev@fosstodon.org**.

## 🐦 Twitter: [@kevquirk](https://twitter.com/kevquirk)

I do have a Twitter account, but I’m not that active on there. I use it mainly to read content and share links to my post. If you want to get in touch with me via Twitter, please feel free.

Contacting me on Twitter may result in a delay in response as I'm really not that active on there.
