Ok, so you're starting an new project (or have an existing project), and you want to start using Simple.css to theme your site. It's very simple to do and you should be able to set something up that looks like this site in just a few minutes.

## Step 1 - create a HTML file

The first thing you're you're going to need is a HTML file so you have something to actually format with Simple.css. Fire up your favourite text editor (my favourite is [Atom](https://atom.io)) and paste this basic HTML into it:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My New Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Hello, world</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>This is my new website and it's using Simple.css. It's really cool. If you want to use it too, you can <a href="https://simplecss.org">visit their site</a>.</p>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <p>Jane Smith's website.</p>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Save this file on your computer somewhere as `index.html`. If you then double-click on that file, it will open in your browser and should look something like this:

Not very nice, I think you will agree. Let's add Simple.css and fix this, shall we?

## Step 2 - add Simple.css

All you need to do to add all the loveliness of Simple.css to your fantastic new site, is download the latest version of Simple.css [from Github](https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css), copy the `simple.min.css` file to the same directory as the `index.html` you just made, then add the following to the `<head>` section of your HTML:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="simple.min.css">
```
Refresh your browser window and ta da! You now have Simple.css formatting on your site. ðŸŽ‰

**That's it. You're done.**

You now have Simple.css formatting your site. All you need to do now is edit the `<header>` and `<footer>` sections to suit your needs. Any content within the main page needs to be added inside the `<main>` tags.

How easy was that! If you want to learn more about adding more styles elements and what's available with Simple.css, take a look at the [demo page](/demo).
