Simple.css is a classless CSS template that allows you to make a good looking website **really** quickly.

By _classless_ we mean that there are no CSS classes anywhere in the CSS or the HTML. So your website can look just like this using plain old vanilla HTML.

Cool, huh?

## Simple.css features

Just because we're using plain old HTML without CSS classes, doesn't mean our site needs to be missing contemporary features.

Simple.css includes the following right out the box:

* A good looking `sans-serif` local font stack.
* Typographic best practices.
* Automagic flipping to dark mode.
* Colours that conform to AAA contrast ratios.
* Sensible defaults that format standard HTML elements.
* Super lightweight, **less than 4 KB in size**.

## Who is Simple.css

Well the short answer to that question is _anyone_ really. But Simple.css really shines when it comes to building simple websites like a personal blog, an about page, or the basis of a new website.

## How to add Simple.css to your site

Adding support for Simple.css to your site is **really** easy to do. Download the `simple.min.css` file from our <a target="blank" [Github repo](https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css) and integrate it into your site with the following line of code in your `<head>`:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/simple.min.css">
```
